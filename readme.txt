Given that the problem statement for the hackathon is to create a functional product using generative AI in the medical diagnosis sector, our team has developed a custom made, meticulously trained , generative AI medical assistance chatbot.
Initial attempts were made to make a encyclopedia bot using python that learns exact responses from its users and learns how to answer them. The code for the Python bot is provided. The data needed to be fed for this python bot to function at the scale we aimed was beyond the scope of our project, so we have internalised an AI software to accept data faster into its knowledge base. 
The chatbot is made using online software called botpress.com. Having a no code approach, we could create our own neural network for our chatbot and add the necessary web citations and references in the knowledge base. 
We tried our level best to apply the Worqhat Api using the hook function and have provided the code for that also.
We have taken the example of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (a famous hospital in Pune) and applied our chatbot as a bubble overlay using our front-end development (html css js) 
We additionally made our own dummy site and applied it there just to show as a demo and on the actual Deenanath Hospital website to demonstrate how it could be used in practice. 
Simply hover over the bubble near the bottom right corner of the screen and the chatbot will be activated. 
You can use it to answer any medical query or assistance as it is backed by a knowledge base of medical sites like WebMD, wikipedia, and governmental or educational websites having a huge dataset on medical information.
It also has in its knowledge base the live Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital site so while it can't apply them it can schedule appointments for users, market Deenanath by promoting treatment there, give extensive information about the hospital. It additionally has been given a sense of identity. It knows it has been developed by a team of 3 developers from MIT and their names. It knows its name and is aware of its capabilities and responsibilities. It adapts and learns according to its users' responses demonstrating machine learning and AI principles to their core.
While waiting for your chatbot to reply please understand it is working through a cloud server where it runs it's information through so the responses can sometimes have a delay (not more than 10-15 secs)
We thought about this project as beyond the scope of a singular hackathon, and into the realm of business and real applicable development. This is a completed project ready for even a business as large as Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital to directly integrate onto it's live site!
